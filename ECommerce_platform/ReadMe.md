Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories

  Data structures are required in handling large inventories as they help in storing data in an organised and structured way. They help in accessing the data in a fast manner. It also helps in data retrieval and search.

Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem

  The type of data structure suitable for this is HashMap. It is best for adding, retrieving or deleting data as the time complexity of such operations is O(1).

Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.

  The time complexity of these operations are constant i.e O(1)

Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

  HashMap are already an optimized way to carry out these operations.
