Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems

Recursion is the process of breaking down a problem to similar subproblems in order to solve it.

Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

  The complexity of the algorithm is O(n)

Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation

  Recursion can be optimized by using Memoization where we store the overlapping subproblems in an array.
